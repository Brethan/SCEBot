blooBot

blooBot is a bot built entirely in JavaScript using the Discord.js library. The bot is charged with the essential managerial duties in a range of Discord servers. It handles commands and helps the server moderators in keeping their servers clean. 

As of July $25^{th}$ 2022, this fork is the current working version of blooBot, renamed to SCEBot for the Systems and Computer Engineering Society Discord server at Carleton Unversity. Please contact services@scesoc.ca for any inquiries on this project. 

As of February 2023, this repository is no longer being updated and has since migrated to the current lastest version of discord.js (14.7.1), as well as the codebase being rewritten in TypeScript and to suppport modularity using an Object Oriented design pattern.
