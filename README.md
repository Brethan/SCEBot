blooBot

blooBot is a bot built entirely in JavaScript using the Discord.js library. The bot is charged with the essential managerial duties in a range of Discord servers. It handles commands, interacts with a weather API to post the hourly forecast, and helps the server moderators in keeping their servers clean. 

This repository is responsible for housing the redesigned version of the bot, which is more efficient in terms of processing times, and memory.
