blooBot

blooBot is a bot built entirely in JavaScript using the Discord.js library. The bot is charged with the essential managerial duties in a range of Discord servers. It handles commands and helps the server moderators in keeping their servers clean. 

As of July $25^{th}$ 2022, this fork is the current working version of blooBot, renamed to SCEBot for the Systems and Computer Engineering Society Discord server at Carleton Unversity. Please contact services@scesoc.ca for any inquiries on this project.
